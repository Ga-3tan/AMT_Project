<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need the following components to use the projet, please make sure you have installed them :

* [Java 11](https://jdk.java.net/11/)
* [Maven 3.6.0](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* IDE of your choice (we used [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/idea/))

### Installation

#### Production version

Ask the team for AWS SSH connection instructions.

No installation needed, see [usage](#Usage) to use the app in production version.

#### Development version (local)

1. Clone the repo.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ga-3tan/AMT_Project.git
```

2. Start the local mongoDB database in a docker container.

```sh
#Run this command in AMT_Project/db-dev/
docker-compose up -d
```

3. The app authentication procedures works in combination with another service. If you want to try these features you will also have to install the following project: https://github.com/Alessandro-AP/JWTAuthentication

4. Ask the team for AWS SSH connection instructions and the JWT secret.

## Usage

### Production version

1. Follow the team's instructions to establish a SSH connection with the application, then you can connect to it with the following address : http://localhost:8082.
2. Play with the app (to try the app in admin privileges, please contact the team).

### Development version (local)

1. Follow the team's instructions to establish a SSH connection with the AWS service.
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE, add the JWT secret (given by the team) to the environment variable and run the Application.

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->

## Contributing

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ga-3tan/AMT_Project.git
```

2. Start the local mongoDB database in a docker container

```sh
#Run this command in AMT_Project/db-dev/
docker-compose up -d
```

3. In the project root, enable git flow (use default configuration)

```sh
#AMT_Project/
git flow init
```

4. Ask the team for AWS SSH connection instructions (secrets) and the JWT secret.

#### New Feature

1. Use **git flow** to create features

```sh
git flow feature start feature_branch
```

2. To end a feature and merge it in the develop branch

```sh
git flow feature finish feature_branch
```

#### Release branch

##### **Create a release branch**

Once a feature is ready for a release, a release branch is forked off of the develop branch by using the following command:

```sh
git flow release start '[version tag]'
```
##### **Finish a release branch**

Once the release is ready to ship, it will get merged it into main and develop, then the release branch will be deleted.

```sh
git flow release finish '[version tag]'
```

_Note: It’s important to merge back into develop because critical updates may have been added to the release branch and they need to be accessible to new features._

#### Hot fix branch

Hotfix branches are a lot like release branches and feature branches except they're based on main instead of develop. __This is the only branch that should fork directly off of main.__

As soon as the fix is complete, it should be merged into both main and develop (or the current release branch), and main should be tagged with an updated version number.

A hotfix branch can be created using the following methods:

   ```sh
git flow hotfix start hotfix_branch
   ```

Then merge the branch to main and develop branch as usual:

   ```sh
git checkout main
git merge hotfix_branch
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix_branch
git branch -D hotfix_branch
   ```

Once done, use the following command to finish the hot fix branch:

   ```sh
git flow hotfix finish hotfix_branch
   ```
